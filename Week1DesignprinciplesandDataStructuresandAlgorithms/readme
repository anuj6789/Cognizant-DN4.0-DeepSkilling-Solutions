## Project 1: Singleton Pattern Logger

### Description
This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern in C#. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global point of access to it. Here, the pattern is used to implement a Logger class, so all logging in the application uses the same Logger instance.

### Features
- Ensures only one Logger instance exists (singleton).
- Thread-safe, lazy initialization using `Lazy<T>`.
- Provides a `Log()` method to print timestamped messages.
- Demonstrates usage in a simple console application.

 ## Project 2: Factory Method Pattern â€“ Document Management System

### Description
This project demonstrates the Factory Method design pattern in C#. It allows the creation of different types of documents (Word, PDF, Excel) using factory classes, without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

### Features
- Abstract document type and concrete implementations for Word, PDF, and Excel.
- Abstract factory and concrete factories for each document type.
- Simple test program to create and open each document type.
