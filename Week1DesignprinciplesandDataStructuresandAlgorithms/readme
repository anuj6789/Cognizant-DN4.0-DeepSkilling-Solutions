Project 1: Singleton Pattern Logger
Description:
Implements the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance of a Logger class is created and used throughout the application. This pattern is useful for logging, configuration, or any scenario where a single shared resource is required.
Features:
Thread-safe, lazy initialization
Global access to the logger instance
Timestamped log messages

Output:
Logger instance created
[LOG 12:34:56] First log entry
[LOG 12:34:56] Second log entry
[LOG 12:34:56] Both logger1 and logger2 refer to the same instance.


2: Factory Method Pattern â€“ Document Management System

Description:
Demonstrates the Factory Method design pattern by creating a document management system that can generate different types of documents (Word, PDF, Excel) without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
Features:
Abstract document type and concrete implementations for Word, PDF, and Excel
Abstract factory and concrete factories for each document type
Simple test program to create and open each document type

 Output:
Opening a Word document.
Opening a PDF document.
Opening an Excel document.

Project 3: E-commerce Platform Search Function
Description:
Implements both linear and binary search algorithms for product lookup in an e-commerce platform. Compares their time complexities and demonstrates the importance of efficient searching for large datasets.
Features:
Product class with ID, name, and category
Linear search (O(n)) and binary search (O(log n)) implementations
Analysis of best, average, and worst-case scenarios

 Output:
Searching for Product ID 307 using Linear Search:
Found: Yoga Mat
Searching for Product ID 205 using Binary Search:
Found: Coffee Maker

Project 4: Financial Forecasting Tool (Recursion)
Description:
A financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data using a recursive algorithm. Demonstrates recursion, time complexity analysis, and how to optimize recursive solutions.

Features:

Recursive method to calculate future value based on growth rates
Analysis of recursion and iterative optimization
Clear, user-friendly output

 Output:

![Financial Forecast Output](project4Financial Forecasting Tool
Starting value: $1000
Forecast after 4 periods: $1286.18
