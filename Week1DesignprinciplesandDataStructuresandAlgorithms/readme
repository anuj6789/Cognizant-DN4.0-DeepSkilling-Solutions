" # Project 1: Singleton Pattern Logger

## Description

This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern in C#. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it. Here, the pattern is used to implement a Logger class, so all logging in the application uses the same Logger instance.

## Features

- Ensures only one Logger instance exists (singleton).
- Thread-safe, lazy initialization using `Lazy<T>`.
- Provides a `Log()` method to print timestamped messages.
- Demonstrates usage in a simple console application. "
